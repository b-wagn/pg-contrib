# Ethereum Specific Contributions

I work as a cryptography researcher at the cryptography team of the Ethereum Foundation.

## Background

- Bachelor's and Master's degree in computer science
- PhD in cryptography, finished May 2024
- Internship at the EF from January to March 2023
- Joined the EF in June 2024

## Past Work

    * [Paper: FRIDA: DAS from FRI](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/248.pdf)

- Cryptography in PeerDAS
    * helping with [cryptography spec](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/tree/dev/specs/_features/eip7594)
    * helping with [C implementation](https://github.com/ethereum/c-kzg-4844)
    * reviewing [Rust implementation](https://github.com/crate-crypto/rust-eth-kzg)
    * documentation and security proof [ethresearch](https://ethresear.ch/t/peerdas-documentation/20361), [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1362.pdf)

- Research on concrete security of BLS signatures
    * [Paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1362.pdf)

- Research on random committee election
    * [Paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1570.pdf)

## Current Work

- signatures for post-quantum Ethereum
    * writing security proofs and prototypes for hash-based candidates
    * exploring other candidates, e.g., lattice-based

- provably secure p2p networking for data availability sampling
